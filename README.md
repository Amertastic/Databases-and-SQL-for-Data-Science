### Executive Summary

The "Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python" section of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate provided a comprehensive introduction to databases, tables, and their relationships. Topics covered included the creation of a database instance on the cloud, basic SQL statements such as CREATE TABLE, SELECT, INSERT, and DELETE, as well as more advanced statements such as ALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE. Additionally, the course covered the usage of string patterns and ranges to search and sort data, grouping data into result sets, and writing sub-queries and nested select statements. The section on accessing databases using Python covered concepts related to connecting to databases, creating tables, loading data, querying data using SQL, and analyzing data using Python. Assignments included working with real-world datasets and querying them using an SQL.

### Technologies and Libraries Used

- SQL language
- Python programming language
- Jupyter Notebook (JupyterLab)
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- ibm_db library for connecting to IBM databases from Python
- IBM Cloud for creating database instance
- SQLite database for storing and manipulating data
- Seaborn for statistical data visualization
- Matplotlib inline for generating plots in Jupyter Notebook


### Dataset

Datasets used in the final assignment can be found as a CSV files in the Data folder

For this project, we used three datasets available on the city of Chicago's Data Portal to explore the relationship between Chicago's socioeconomic indicators, public school performance, and crime rates. 

The first dataset, ChicagoCensusData.csv, contained six socioeconomic indicators and a hardship index for each Chicago community area for the years 2008-2012.
A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2

The second dataset, ChicagoPublicSchools.csv, included all school-level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year. 
A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t

Lastly, the third dataset, ChicagoCrimeData.csv, reflected reported incidents of crime (excluding murders) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. 
A detailed description of this dataset and the original dataset can be obtained from the Chicago Data Portal at: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

We analyzed and visualized the data from these datasets to better understand the relationship between these different factors in Chicago.

The collection of projects uploaded on the GitHub repo demonstrate a solid understanding of databases and SQL for data science with Python. The projects cover the essential skills and concepts required to work with databases, including creating and executing basic SQL statements, creating and manipulating tables, using string patterns and ranges to search data, sorting and grouping data, composing nested queries, and accessing databases using Python.

We see that the points on the scatter plot are somewhat closer to a straight line in the negative direction, so we have a negative correlation between the two variables.* |


The notebooks show a deep understanding of SQL concepts such as string patterns, ranges, and sub-queries, as well as data analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The ability to translate data analysis questions into SQL queries and interpret the results is also demonstrated in the projects.
